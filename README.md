# TermiCraft (Minecraft in Terminal)

**Not the minecraft playable in terminal like in 3D**

Relearning python and trying out new stuffs specifically `@properties` decorator. I used Minecraft's design as an example because I like Minecraft a lot, I played since my teens until now though ocassionaly, and I'm also interested in implementing it my own way. I know, I know, probably has optimization issues or something but that's something I'll slowly resolve when I like.
